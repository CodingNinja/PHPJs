PHPJs
======

PHJs is a PHP5.3 library which enables developers to write powerful javascript
from the comfort of PHP.

PHPJs is built ontop of a powerful manager class which knows the existance of all
current "components" and allows developers to code all their javascript without
the need to worry about the dependencies between each component.

By utilising powerful PHP5.3 features, we have been able to make PHPJs an extremly
fast, scalable and powerful solution that is ready for use in enteprise.

PHPJs classes are rarely instatiated and instead, developers should extend the 
classes it provides to craete powerful, object oriented javascript.

PHPJs even supports writing pure javascript in PHP code. By supporting a fluent API 
and no set methods, the CustomFunction class enables a developer to write full javascript
functions in PURE PHP code.
